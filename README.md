# Proast
> Celebrate Lifes Curses

Ever get stuck giving a toast. We've got you covered. Proast will choose a random toast for you to share.

Use your terminal to get a toast at random:

```shell
# No need to install if you use npx

~
❯ npx proast
npx: installed 4 in 2.203s
may both sides of your pillow be warm.

# or you can install globally
~
❯ npm install -g proast


~
❯ proast
may your audio tracks be always just a little slower than the video.
```

## JSON

This is a simple web app that digests a JSON file of toasts. If you'd wish to incorporate these toasts, you can grab the raw JSON through https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morriswchris/proast/master/curses.json. This will be the latest and greatest file.

## Contributions

Contributions as more than welcome, especially more toast! Please fork the repo and submit a pull to master. If you are adding toasts, please ensure they do not already exist. (Maybe soon I'll write something to check for duplicates)

## Notes

The initial curses.json file was curated through various sources online. I am by no means the owner of these.
